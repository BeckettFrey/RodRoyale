## 📈 Analytics & Insights

### Trackable Metrics
- User engagement with leaderboards
- Most popular competition metrics
- Species-specific participation rates
- Social follow patterns driven by competition

### Business Value
- **Increased Engagement**: Regular competitive cycles
- **Social Growth**: Following relationships drive network effects  
- **Content Creation**: Competition motivates more catch uploads
- **Retention**: Monthly cycles create recurring engagement

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Monthly Time Window
```python
month_ago = datetime.utcnow() - timedelta(days=30)
month_catches = [c for c in catches if c.get('created_at') >= month_ago]
```

### Ranking Algorithm
```python
# Sort by metric (descending)
leaderboard.sort(key=lambda x: x[metric], reverse=True)

# Add rankings
for i, user in enumerate(leaderboard):
    user["rank"] = i + 1
```

### Current User Highlighting
```python
user_stats["is_current_user"] = (user_id == current_user_id)
```
