# SECURITY_OUTLINE

This document provides an overview of the security mechanisms implemented in the Rod Royale Backend.

## 1. Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication using access and refresh tokens.
- Passwords are securely hashed with bcrypt via Passlib.
- Token validation and user lookup are performed for each request.

## 2. Environment & Secrets
- SECRET_KEY is required for JWT signing. If not set, a temporary key is generated (not recommended for production).
- Sensitive configuration is loaded from environment variables.

## 3. Database Security
- MongoDB indexes are created for performance and uniqueness (e.g., email, username).
- User IDs are validated as ObjectId before database queries.

## 4. Error Handling
- JWT and database errors are logged and return appropriate HTTP status codes.
- Invalid or expired tokens result in 401 Unauthorized responses.

## 5. Password Reset
- TODO

---
For production, I'll ensure all secrets are set and use a secure deployment strategy.
